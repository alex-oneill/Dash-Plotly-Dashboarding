# Dash-Ploty-Dashboarding

### Project #2 - CS632P-Python Programming
*Prof. Sarbanes*


In this project you will need to use Python’s dash and plotly modules.

*- Devise a Python app that will read the following dataset (securities_prices_volumes.csv)*

The app will have the following functionality, components:
1. Upload the csv, after browsing into your machine, into the app.
2. After clicking on parsing data, select the appropriate data type for each of the columns. Do provide the option to ‘ignore’ any column.
3. Then preview the data, along with a corresponding line graph (you can use your own names/labels for each column).

*Should you choose more than one security from the 2nd drop-down list, the line graph should look like:
(You could easily plot ‘Volume’ instead of ‘Adj Close’ price from the 1st drop-down list)*
